Could you elaborate on the previously mentioned requirements by also incorporating at least two sophisticated techniques for data transformation in C++? These methods could include the likes of interpolation or Fourier transforms. It would be great if you could demonstrate how to implement these techniques via code snippets alongside the three conventional methods mentioned in the initial prompt.

Certainly! Here is an expanded table of ten Australian nocturnal animals with unique physical adaptations:
| Animal | Native Habitat | Physical Adaptation | Evolutionary History and Ecological Significance |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Bilby  | Desert regions of Western and Central Australia | Long, rabbit-like ears and powerful forelimbs for digging | Bilbies are thought to be one of the oldest surviving marsupials in Australia, with fossils dating back 15 million years. They play a crucial role in their ecosystem by digging burrows that provide shelter for other animals and help aerate the soil. |
| Sugar Glider | Woodlands and forests throughout Australia | Flaps of skin between their legs that allow them to glide through the air | Sugar gliders are believed to have evolved their gliding ability as a way to escape predators and find food more efficiently. They play an important role in pollination and seed dispersal in their native habitats. |
| Quokka | Rottnest Island and small pockets of Western Australia | Strong hind legs for jumping and climbing | Quokkas are considered an important part of the ecosystem on Rottnest Island, where they help control vegetation and provide food for predators like snakes and eagles. They have also become a popular tourist attraction due to their friendly and curious nature. |
| Greater Glider | Forests along the eastern coast of Australia | Skin flaps that allow them to glide up to 100 meters through the air | Greater gliders are considered a keystone species in their native habitats, as they help maintain the health and diversity of forest ecosystems by dispersing seeds and providing food for predators like owls and pythons. |
| Wombat | Forested areas and grasslands throughout Australia | Thick, sturdy legs and sharp claws for digging burrows | Wombats play an important role in their ecosystem by digging burrows that provide shelter for other animals and help aerate the soil. They are also considered a keystone species in some areas, as their burrows can help prevent erosion and provide a source of water during dry periods. |
| Tasmanian Devil | Tasmania and small pockets of mainland Australia | Strong jaws and sharp teeth for crushing bones and eating carrion | Tasmanian devils are the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world and play an important role in their ecosystem by scavenging carrion and helping to control populations of small mammals. They are also considered a threatened species due to a contagious facial tumor disease. |
| Tree Kangaroo | Rainforests in northeastern Australia and Papua New Guinea | Strong hind legs and long tails for climbing trees | Tree kangaroos are considered a keystone species in their native habitats, as they help maintain the health and diversity of forest ecosystems by dispersing seeds and providing food for predators like pythons and eagles. They are also threatened by habitat loss and hunting. |
| Numbat | Eucalyptus forests in Western Australia | Long, sticky tongue for catching termites | Numbats are considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and predation by introduced predators like foxes and feral cats. They play an important role in their ecosystem by controlling termite populations and providing food for predators like snakes and owls. |
| Bandicoot | Forested areas and grasslands throughout Australia | Long, pointed snout for digging up insects and plant roots | Bandicoots are considered an important part of the ecosystem in their native habitats, as they help control insect populations and disperse seeds. They are also threatened by habitat loss and predation by introduced predators like foxes and feral cats. |
| Tasmanian Pademelon | Tasmania and small pockets of mainland Australia | Short, powerful legs for jumping and sharp claws for climbing | Tasmanian pademelons are considered an important part of the ecosystem on Tasmania, where they help control vegetation and provide food for predators like Tasmanian devils and quolls. They are also threatened by habitat loss and predation by introduced predators like foxes and feral cats. |
Each of these nocturnal animals has evolved unique physical adaptations that allow them to thrive in their specific environmental niche. These adaptations have helped them survive in their native habitats for millions of years, and they continue to play important ecological roles today. By understanding the mechanisms behind these adaptations, we can gain a better appreciation for the complexity and diversity of life on Earth.

Here's a MATLAB code that meets the criteria you specified:
```
% Define the character sets
upper = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
lower = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
digits = '0123456789';
special = '~!@#$%^&*';
% Generate the password
while true
    % Shuffle the character sets
    upper_shuffled = upper(randperm(length(upper)));
    lower_shuffled = lower(randperm(length(lower)));
    digits_shuffled = digits(randperm(length(digits)));
    special_shuffled = special(randperm(length(special)));
    
    % Concatenate the shuffled character sets
    password = [upper_shuffled(1:2) lower_shuffled(1:2) digits_shuffled(1:2) special_shuffled(1:2)];
    
    % Add random characters until the password is 14 characters long
    while length(password) < 14
        % Define the remaining character set
        remaining = [upper_shuffled(3:end) lower_shuffled(3:end) digits_shuffled(3:end) special_shuffled(3:end)];
        
        % Add a random character from the remaining set
        password = [password remaining(randi(length(remaining)))];
    end
    
    % Check if the password meets the criteria
    if all(isstrprop(password, 'alpha')) && ... % starts and ends with a letter
       sum(isstrprop(password, 'upper')) >= 2 && ... % at least two uppercase letters
       sum(isstrprop(password, 'lower')) >= 2 && ... % at least two lowercase letters
       sum(isstrprop(password, 'digit')) >= 2 && ... % at least two numbers
       sum(ismember(password, special)) >= 2 && ... % at least two special characters
       length(unique(password)) == length(password) % no repeated characters
        break % the password meets the criteria
    end
end
disp(password) % display the password
``` 
Note that this code uses a while loop to generate passwords until one meets the criteria. This means that the code may take a while to run if it takes many attempts to generate a valid password.
