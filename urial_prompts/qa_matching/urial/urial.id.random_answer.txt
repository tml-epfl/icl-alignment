1. Two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication is a security feature that requires users to enter a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to their mobile device or an answer to a security question, in addition to their login credentials. This measure can help protect against unauthorized access to sensitive data, even if an attacker has obtained a user's login information.

2. Data encryption: Data encryption is a technique used to protect data by converting it into a code that is unreadable without the appropriate encryption key. This measure can help protect sensitive data, such as financial information or personally identifiable information, from being accessed by unauthorized individuals in the event of a data breach.

3. Firewall protection: A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. This measure can help prevent unauthorized access to a company's network and data by blocking unauthorized traffic and identifying potential security threats.
