I'm trying to use UUIDs for the `_id` field in my MongoDB database. I have a wrapper struct called `mongoWrapper` that contains an `ID` field of type `uuid.UUID`. Here's the code:

```go
type mongoWrapper struct {
    ID      uuid.UUID       `bson:"_id" json:"_id"`
    Payment storage.Payment `bson:"payment" json:"payment"`
}

func (s *Storage) Create(newPayment storage.Payment) (uuid.UUID, error) {
    mongoInsert := wrap(newPayment)
    c := s.client.Database(thisDatabase).Collection(thisCollection)

    insertResult, errInsert := c.InsertOne(context.TODO(), mongoInsert)
    if errInsert != nil {
        return uuid.Nil, errInsert
    }

    fmt.Println("Inserted a single document: ", insertResult.InsertedID)

    return mongoInsert.ID, nil
}

func wrap(p storage.Payment, i ...uuid.UUID) *mongoWrapper {
    mw := &mongoWrapper{ID: uuid.Nil, Payment: p}

    if len(i) > 0 {
        mw.ID = i[0]
        return mw
    }

    newID, errID := uuid.NewV4()
    if errID != nil {
        log.Fatal(errID)
    }

    mw.ID = newID

    return mw
}
```

When I run one of my tests that calls the `Create()` function, I get the following error:

```
storage_test.go:38: err: multiple write errors: [{write errors: [{can't use an array for _id}]}, {<nil>}]
```

I'm using the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` package for UUIDs and the `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo` package. I'm not sure where the problem lies. Do I need to do something extra to handle the UUID correctly?

Edit: I made some changes to the code by adding a new type `mongoUUID` to the `mongoWrapper` struct and implementing `MarshalBSON()` and `UnmarshalBSON()` methods, but the UUID still comes through as an array:

```go
type mongoWrapper struct {
    UUID    mongoUUID       `bson:"uuid" json:"uuid"`
    Payment storage.Payment `bson:"payment" json:"payment"`
}

type mongoUUID struct {
    uuid.UUID
}

func (mu *mongoUUID) MarshalBSON() ([]byte, error) {
    return []byte(mu.UUID.String()), nil
}

func (mu *mongoUUID) UnmarshalBSON(b []byte) error {
    mu.UUID = uuid.FromStringOrNil(string(b))
    return nil
}
```

Can someone help me figure out what's causing this issue?

Can you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?
```

# Answer:
```
Hello! Certainly! Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally and sustainably on a human timescale. Here are some common types of renewable energy sources:

1. Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the sun. It can be used for heating, lighting, and generating electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal systems.

2. Wind Energy: Energy generated from the natural movement of air. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power, which can then be converted into electricity.

3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric Power): Energy derived from the movement of water. This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements, or wave power. Hydroelectric power plants typically use a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir; water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity.

4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic materials such as plants, wood, and waste. When these materials are burned or converted into biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel), they can be used as an energy source for heating, electricity, and transportation.

5. Geothermal Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. This can include the use of hot springs for direct heating applications or the drilling of geothermal wells to produce steam that can drive turbines for electricity generation.


Each of these renewable energy sources has its own advantages and challenges in terms of technology, cost, and the potential impact on the environment. However, they all offer a more sustainable and often cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Please let me know if you have any other questions!

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? 
```

# Answer:
```
Hi, I'm happy to help you. To solve the problem, let's think step by step:

1. In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends.
2. In May, she sold half as many as she did in April. So, the number of clips she sold in May = 48/2 = 24.
3. To find out how many clips she sold altogether in April and May, simply add the number of clips from both months: 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips.

Therefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May. Please feel free to ask me if you have any more questions!

What is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? 
```

# Answer:
```
Hello! I'm happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep frying a turkey can be a delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it's important to do it safely to avoid accidents. Here's a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:

1. Choose the right turkey: Select a fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird can cause the oil to boil over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.
2. Prepare the turkey: Thoroughly thaw and dry the turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter and ensure a crispy skin.
3. Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and herbs. You can use a dry rub or inject the seasoning directly into the meat.
4. Prepare the fryer: Set up the turkey fryer outside on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable materials. Fill the fryer with peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350째F (163-177째C).
5. Lower the turkey into the fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.
6. Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound. Monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the recommended range.
7. Remove the turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C), carefully and slowly lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place it on a wire rack or tray to drain any excess oil.
8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20-30 minutes before carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist, flavorful turkey.

Remember to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave the fryer unattended, and keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally, always follow the manufacturer's instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer model.
