I'm trying to create a constructor for my struct, which would store an iterator over `String` read from file. The problem is that once the functions returns, `String` is dropped and compiler complains `new() returns a value referencing data owned by the current function`. Is there a way to associate `String` with a struct somehow so that it is not dropped after return?
I think I understand a complaint here but I don't understand how to deal with it, because I want constructor to deal both with file reading and iterator creation.

```rust
pub struct CharStream<'a> {
    input: std::str::Chars<'a>,
    filename: String,
}
impl<'a> CharStream<'a> {
    pub fn new(filename: String) -> CharStream<'a> {
        let mut file = File::open(&filename).unwrap();
        let mut input = String::new();
        file.read_to_string(&mut input);
        CharStream {
            input: input.chars(), // Create an iterator over `input`
            filename: filename,
        }
        // `input` is dropped here
    }
}

I am trying to use the `.UnionAll` method in the go-pg library for golang. Here is the code I am using:

```go
var model []Customer
q0 := db.Model(&model).Where("name = ?", name0).Limit(4)
q1 := db.Model(&model).Where("name = ?", name1).Limit(3)
var result []Customer
if err := q0.UnionAll(q1).Limit(1).Select(&result); !as.NoError(err) {
    return
}
```

The generated query is not what I expect. It currently produces:

```sql
(SELECT "customer"."id", "customer"."name" FROM customers AS "customer" WHERE (name = 'customer 1deificatory zonoid reprepare alacrify serenissime') 
LIMIT 1) 
UNION ALL 
(SELECT "customer"."id", "customer"."name" FROM customers AS "customer" WHERE (name = 'customer 2fordless ferroboron radiability dandizette smutch'
LIMIT 3)
)
```

But I expect it to be:

```sql
(SELECT "customer"."id", "customer"."name" FROM customers AS "customer" WHERE (name = 'customer 1deificatory zonoid reprepare alacrify serenissime') 
LIMIT 4) 
UNION ALL 
(SELECT "customer"."id", "customer"."name" FROM customers AS "customer" WHERE (name = 'customer 2fordless ferroboron radiability dandizette smutch')
LIMIT 3)

LIMIT 1
```

How can I modify the go-pg code to get the raw SQL query that I expect? I can't seem to apply the `Limit 1` expression to the whole query, and the `Limit 4` is not correctly applied to the first `union all` member. Here is the link to my full code: [github.com/ypapax/go-pg-unionall/main_test.go](https://github.com/ypapax/go-pg-unionall/blob/master/main_test.go#L94).

I am making a basic C kernel for a project and I am compiling it with an i686-elf cross compiler for Windows. However, when I actually boot from the USB stick, it goes crazy and puts a weird symbol by the bottom right corner of my screen. I have an i7-3770K CPU. Can someone explain why this is happening?

        vidptr[j] = ' ';
        vidptr[j+1] = 0x07;
        j = j+2;
    }
}

Create a sophisticated algorithm capable of detecting the most frequently used word in a diverse range of text data. The algorithm should be able to adapt to a variety of spelling variations, including abbreviations, misspellings, and alternative spellings. Additionally, the system should be efficient in processing large volumes of text data and account for commonly encountered issues such as stop words and stemming. In particular, the algorithm must be capable of handling various sources of text data, including chat logs, social media posts, and speech transcripts. For instance, suppose you are given a dataset consisting of a collection of text messages: ["Hey man, how's it going?", "Not much, just hanging out with the boiz", "Yo you wanna grab a bite to eat later?"]. Can you devise an algorithm that can accurately identify the most commonly used word in such a dataset?

How can I use JavaScript to randomly select 5 unique skills and qualifications from a list of 10, without repeating any of them? 
Here's the list of 10 skills and qualifications:
["Experience with surgeries", "Knowledge of medical software", "Communication skills", "Ability to work under pressure", "Attention to detail", "Problem-solving skills", "Leadership abilities", "Teamwork skills", "Empathy", "Flexibility"]
And here's the JavaScript code to randomly select 5 unique skills and qualifications from the list:
```
const skills = ["Experience with surgeries", "Knowledge of medical software", "Communication skills", "Ability to work under pressure", "Attention to detail", "Problem-solving skills", "Leadership abilities", "Teamwork skills", "Empathy", "Flexibility"];
const selectedSkills = [];
while (selectedSkills.length < 5) {
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * skills.length);
  const skill = skills[randomIndex];
  if (!selectedSkills.includes(skill)) {
    selectedSkills.push(skill);
  }
}
console.log(selectedSkills);
```
This code uses a while loop to keep randomly selecting skills from the list until 5 unique skills have been selected. The Math.random() function is used to generate a random index for the skills array, and the includes() method is used to check whether the skill has already been selected. Once 5 unique skills have been selected, they are stored in the selectedSkills array.

```
Can you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?
```

# Answer:
```
Hello! Certainly! Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally and sustainably on a human timescale. Here are some common types of renewable energy sources:

1. Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the sun. It can be used for heating, lighting, and generating electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal systems.

2. Wind Energy: Energy generated from the natural movement of air. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power, which can then be converted into electricity.

3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric Power): Energy derived from the movement of water. This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements, or wave power. Hydroelectric power plants typically use a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir; water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity.

4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic materials such as plants, wood, and waste. When these materials are burned or converted into biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel), they can be used as an energy source for heating, electricity, and transportation.

5. Geothermal Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. This can include the use of hot springs for direct heating applications or the drilling of geothermal wells to produce steam that can drive turbines for electricity generation.


Each of these renewable energy sources has its own advantages and challenges in terms of technology, cost, and the potential impact on the environment. However, they all offer a more sustainable and often cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Please let me know if you have any other questions!

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? 
```

# Answer:
```
Hi, I'm happy to help you. To solve the problem, let's think step by step:

1. In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends.
2. In May, she sold half as many as she did in April. So, the number of clips she sold in May = 48/2 = 24.
3. To find out how many clips she sold altogether in April and May, simply add the number of clips from both months: 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips.

Therefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May. Please feel free to ask me if you have any more questions!

What is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? 
```

# Answer:
```
Hello! I'm happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep frying a turkey can be a delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it's important to do it safely to avoid accidents. Here's a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:

1. Choose the right turkey: Select a fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird can cause the oil to boil over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.
2. Prepare the turkey: Thoroughly thaw and dry the turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter and ensure a crispy skin.
3. Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and herbs. You can use a dry rub or inject the seasoning directly into the meat.
4. Prepare the fryer: Set up the turkey fryer outside on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable materials. Fill the fryer with peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350°F (163-177°C).
5. Lower the turkey into the fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.
6. Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound. Monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the recommended range.
7. Remove the turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place it on a wire rack or tray to drain any excess oil.
8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20-30 minutes before carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist, flavorful turkey.

Remember to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave the fryer unattended, and keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally, always follow the manufacturer's instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer model.
