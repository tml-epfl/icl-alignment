Why can't I create a set of sets in Python? I was trying to implement a powerset function and discovered that Python sets are not hashable. When I tried to create a set of sets I received a TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'. Is there a specific reason why Python sets are not hashable?

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; set([ set() ])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'
</code></pre>
```

# Answer:
```
The reason Python sets are not hashable is due to the mutable nature of sets. Hashability in Python requires that the hashed object remains constant throughout its lifetime. This means that mutable objects, like sets, cannot be hashed since their content can change over time.

However, Python provides an immutable counterpart to sets called "frozensets". Frozensets are hashable sets, they are created using the `frozenset()` function.

For example, you can create a set of frozensets like this:

```python
>>> s = set([ frozenset() ])
>>> print(s)
{frozenset()}
```

This works because a `frozenset` is a built-in set in Python which is immutable and hashable. Its elements cannot be changed after it is created, making it a suitable candidate for a set of sets, or a powerset.

I am currently learning Ruby on Rails and using libraries like Mechanize. I find it helpful to use iPython for introspection when working with Python. Is there a similar tool in Ruby that allows me to easily see what I'm working with in terms of introspection? Specifically, I would like to be able to type "." + TAB and see the available options.
```

# Answer:
```
Yes, there is a tool in Ruby that can help you with autocompletion and introspection. You can use the `irb/completion` library to achieve this.

To get started, you need to require the `irb/completion` library in your Ruby code. Here's an example:

```ruby
require 'irb/completion'
```

By requiring this library, you enable autocompletion functionality in your Ruby program. Now, when you type "." followed by the TAB key in your code, you will see a list of available options for introspection.

For example, let's say you have an object called `my_object` and you want to see the available methods and attributes for it. You can simply type `my_object.` and press the TAB key. The autocompletion feature will display a list of available options related to `my_object`, such as methods and attributes.

This can be very helpful when exploring new libraries or working with unfamiliar code. It allows you to quickly see what options are available and helps you write code more efficiently.

So, by requiring the `irb/completion` library, you can easily achieve autocompletion and introspection in Ruby, similar to what you're familiar with in iPython.

I have the following C# code that populates a DataGrid with data from a database. However, when I run the code, it displays both my custom column names and the column names from the database. How can I make it only display my custom column names?

```csharp
private void ViewWinLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var stud = from s in data.Students
               select s;
    Student[] st = stud.ToArray<Student>();
    datagrid.ItemsSource = st;
}
```

```xaml
<DataGrid x:Name="datagrid" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Height="232" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="461">
    <DataGrid.Columns>
        <DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=StudentID}" ClipboardContentBinding="{x:Null}" Header="StudentID"/>
        <DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=FirstName}" ClipboardContentBinding="{x:Null}" Header="First Name"/>
        <DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=LastName}" ClipboardContentBinding="{x:Null}" Header="Last Name"/>
        <DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=Gender}" ClipboardContentBinding="{x:Null}" Header="Gender"/>
        <DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Path=GPA}" ClipboardContentBinding="{x:Null}" Header="GPA"/>
    </DataGrid.Columns>
</DataGrid>
```
```

# Answer:
```
To display only your custom column names and exclude the column names from the database, you can set the `AutoGenerateColumns` property of the DataGrid to `False`. This will prevent the DataGrid from automatically generating columns based on the properties of the data source.

Here's the modified XAML code:

```xaml
<DataGrid x:Name="datagrid" AutoGenerateColumns="False" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Height="232" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="461">
```

By setting `AutoGenerateColumns` to `False`, you are telling the DataGrid to only display the columns that you explicitly define in the XAML code, which are the ones with your custom column names.

I have a method that takes an array of strings and joins them so they do something like this:

```
>> my_arr
=> ["A", "B", "C"]
>> and_join(my_arr)
=> "A, B, and C"
```

Which I'd like my mailer to have access to so I can output some information into an email. I can't seem to find a good place to put it and putting it in the application_helper.rb file and it doesn't find it there. Where should it go?
```

# Answer:
```
You can define the helper method in a separate module and then include it in your mailer using the `helper` method. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a new file called `mailer_helper.rb` and define the `and_join` method in a module called `MailerHelper`. This module will contain all your helper methods.

  ```ruby
  # mailer_helper.rb
  module MailerHelper
    def and_join(arr)
      # Your code to join the array elements goes here
    end
  end
  ```

2. In your mailer file (e.g., `my_mailer.rb`), include the `MailerHelper` module using the `helper` method. This will make the helper methods available in your mailer and its views.

  ```ruby
  # my_mailer.rb
  class MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base
    helper MailerHelper
    # Your mailer code goes here
  end
  ```

By including the `MailerHelper` module in your mailer, you can now call the `and_join` method inside your mailer's view templates to join arrays and output the desired information in your emails.

I want to compare two 16-bit numbers and branch on the result: the equivalent of "if (a<b) goto negative". I'm using an Intel 8080. The Z80 has a signed arithmetic overflow flag which can be used for this with some degree of effort. The standard code is:
```
ld de, _left
ld hl, _right
ld a, e
sub a, l
ld a, d
sbc a, h
jp po, $+5  ; branch on overflow flag not set
xor a, 0x80 ; flip sign bit
jm negative ; actually do the test
```
But the 8080 isn't a strict subset of the Z80, and the code above won't work there --- on the 8080, arithmetic instructions set the P flag based on the parity of the result, with hilarious results. So what's the idiomatic way to do signed comparisons on the 8080? Actually calculating the overflow flag is possible but really painful as it requires doing bit operations on both the operands and the result, and I'm running out of registers. Also, it's not actually what I want here; I don't actually care about the overflow. I just want to do the comparison. (I can't simply subtract and branch if the result is negative because that doesn't work in all cases. Consider INT_MIN < INT_MAX. That's 0x8000 - 0x7fff = 1, which is obviously positive.)
```

# Answer:
```
You can use the following code to perform signed comparisons on the Intel 8080 processor. This code compares two 16-bit numbers stored in the DE and HL registers and branches based on the result:

```assembly
mov a, d
xra h
jp sameSigns   ; branch if sign bits are equal

; sign bits are different, signed overflow may happen
; but if H is positive, then DE is less than HL
xra d           ; make A=H and set sign flag
jm DeIsGreaterEqualThanHl

:DeIsLessThanHl
; DE < HL
...

:sameSigns
; sign bits are equal, it is safe to do ordinary subtraction
mov a, e
sub l
mov a, d
sbb h
jc DeIsLessThanHl

:DeIsGreaterEqualThanHl
; DE >= HL
...
```

This code first checks if the sign bits of the two numbers are equal. If they are, it performs a subtraction and checks the carry flag to determine the result of the comparison. If the sign bits are different, it assumes that signed overflow may happen, but if the H register (which holds the sign bit of HL) is positive, then DE is less than HL. If the sign bits are equal, it performs a subtraction and again checks the carry flag to determine the result of the comparison.

Note that this code assumes that the numbers in DE and HL are already in signed format (using two's complement representation). If they are not, you may need to adjust the code accordingly. Additionally, make sure to replace the `...` placeholders with the appropriate code for your specific application.

How can I write a function in Python that finds the maximum of three integers?
```

# Answer:
```
You can use the following code to define a function that finds the maximum of three integers:

```python
def maxThree(a, b, c): 
    max = a 
  
    if b > max: 
        max = b 
  
    if c > max: 
        max = c 
  
    return max 
```

To use this function, you need to provide three integer values as arguments, like this:

```python
result = maxThree(3, 9, 5) 
print(result)
```

In this example, the function `maxThree` takes three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the three integers. It compares each integer with the current maximum value, starting with the first integer `a`. If any of the subsequent integers `b` or `c` is greater than the current maximum, it updates the maximum accordingly. Finally, the function returns the maximum value.

In the given code example, we pass the values `3`, `9`, and `5` to the `maxThree` function, which will output `9` as the maximum value.

Can you provide an example of how to create a class called Vehicle and instantiate 5 different objects of different types using that class?
```

# Answer:
```
Sure, here's an example of how you can achieve that:

```
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, vehicle_type):
        self.type = vehicle_type

car = Vehicle("car")
bus = Vehicle("bus")
motorcycle = Vehicle("motorcycle")
truck = Vehicle("truck")
van = Vehicle("van")
```

In this example, we define a class called Vehicle with a constructor (`__init__`) that takes a parameter `vehicle_type` to specify the type of the vehicle object. Inside the constructor, we assign the `vehicle_type` parameter to the `type` attribute of the object.

To create different objects of type car, bus, motorcycle, truck, and van, we simply instantiate the Vehicle class with the desired vehicle type. For example, `car = Vehicle("car")` creates an object of type car and assigns it to the `car` variable. Similarly, we create objects for the other vehicle types.

By using this approach, you can create multiple objects with different types based on the Vehicle class.

I want to create a function that recommends similar movies based on the movies of a specific genre. Can someone help me with the code?
```

# Answer:
```
Sure! Here's a solution using pandas library in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("movies.csv")

def get_movie_recommendations(genre):
    # Select all movies with the specified genre
    genre_movies = df[df['genre'] == genre]
    
    # Get list of all the movie IDs
    movie_ids = list(genre_movies['movieId'])
    
    # Get a list of movie recommendations for each movie
    recs = {}
    for m in movie_ids:
        recs[m] = list(genre_movies[genre_movies['movieId'] != m]['movieId'])
    
    return recs

# Test
print(get_movie_recommendations('Romance'))
```

This code defines a function called `get_movie_recommendations` that takes a genre as input. It loads a dataset from a CSV file called "movies.csv" using the pandas library.

Inside the function, it selects all movies from the dataset that match the specified genre. It then gets a list of movie IDs for these movies. Next, it creates an empty dictionary called `recs` to store the movie recommendations.

Using a loop, the code iterates over each movie ID and retrieves a list of movie IDs for all other movies in the same genre, excluding the current movie. These recommendations are added to the `recs` dictionary, with the current movie ID as the key.

Finally, the function returns the `recs` dictionary. In the test section, it calls the function with the genre 'Romance' and prints the result.

This code should recommend similar movies based on the movies of a specific genre. Let me know if you have any further questions!

How can I develop a Java program that finds the second largest element of a given array?
```

# Answer:
```
You can achieve this by using the following code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
  
public class SecondLargestInArrayExample1{  
    public static int getSecondLargest(int[] a, int total){  
        Arrays.sort(a);  
        return a[total-2];  
    }  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        int a[]={12,35,47,78,90,22};  
        int b[]={-4,-8,4,5,9};  
        System.out.println("Second Largest: "+getSecondLargest(a,6));  
        System.out.println("Second Largest: "+getSecondLargest(b,5));  
    }  
}
```

In this program, the `getSecondLargest` method takes an array `a` and the total number of elements `total` as parameters. It uses the `Arrays.sort()` method to sort the array in ascending order. Then, it returns the second largest element by accessing `a[total-2]`. 

In the `main` method, two example arrays `a` and `b` are declared and initialized. The program prints the second largest element of each array by calling the `getSecondLargest` method and concatenating the result with the string "Second Largest: ".

I want to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit in my Python program. Can someone help me with a function for this conversion?
```

# Answer:
```
Sure! Here's a function that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit in Python:

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c):
    f = (c * 9/5) + 32
    return f
```

To use this function, you can simply provide the Celsius temperature as an argument to the function, and it will return the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature. For example, if you want to convert 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can call the function like this:

```python
temperature_celsius = 25
temperature_fahrenheit = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temperature_celsius)
print(temperature_fahrenheit)  # Output: 77.0
```

In the function, `c` represents the temperature in Celsius. The formula `(c * 9/5) + 32` is used to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. It multiplies the Celsius temperature by 9/5 and adds 32 to get the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature. Finally, the function returns the Fahrenheit temperature.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Is there a way to convert all the text on a website from plain text to bold using jQuery?
```

# Answer:
```
Yes, you can achieve this by using the following jQuery code:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $('*').css('font-weight', 'bold');
});
```

In this code, the `$(document).ready()` function ensures that the code is executed once the DOM is fully loaded. The `$('*)` selector selects all elements in the DOM. Finally, the `.css('font-weight', 'bold')` method sets the CSS property `font-weight` to `bold` for all selected elements, effectively making the text appear bold.

By including this code in your website, all text content will be displayed in bold.

A system undergoes simple harmonic motion with an amplitude of 8 cm and a period of 2 seconds. If the displacement of the system is given by the equation x(t) = 8 cos(πt), what is the maximum velocity of the system?
```

# Answer:
```
To find the maximum velocity of the system, we need to differentiate the displacement equation x(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity equation v(t).

x(t) = 8 cos(πt)

Differentiating x(t) with respect to time t:

v(t) = dx(t)/dt = -8π sin(πt)

The maximum velocity occurs when the sine function has its maximum value, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum velocity is:

v_max = -8π(1) = -8π cm/s

However, since we are only interested in the magnitude of the maximum velocity, we can ignore the negative sign:

v_max = 8π cm/s ≈ 25.13 cm/s

What is the exact value of the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust, which is created by removing the middle third of a line segment repeatedly, n times, where n approaches infinity?
```

# Answer:
```
The Cantor dust, also known as the Cantor set, is created by iteratively removing the middle third of a line segment. The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:

Hausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(M)

where N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.

In the case of the Cantor set, each iteration removes the middle third of the line segment, leaving 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2) and a scaling factor of 3 (M = 3).

So, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:

Hausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) ≈ 0.6309

The exact value of the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is log(2) / log(3).

Consider a graph G with 7 vertices. Find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
```

# Answer:
```
To find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, we need to consider the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph. The maximum degree (Δ) is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex.

In the worst-case scenario, we have a complete graph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, each vertex has a degree of 6 (since there are 7 vertices in total). According to the greedy coloring algorithm, we can color a graph with Δ + 1 colors, where Δ is the maximum degree of the graph.

Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, is 6 + 1 = 7 colors.

How does the aging process affect the body's ability to regulate blood pressure and what are the physiological mechanisms responsible for these changes?
```

# Answer:
```
Aging is a complex process that affects various physiological systems in the body, including the cardiovascular system. As we age, our body's ability to regulate blood pressure can be compromised, leading to an increased risk of hypertension (high blood pressure) and other cardiovascular diseases. There are several physiological mechanisms responsible for these changes:

1. Arterial stiffness: With age, the walls of the arteries become less elastic and more rigid due to the accumulation of collagen and the degradation of elastin. This arterial stiffness reduces the ability of the arteries to expand and contract in response to changes in blood pressure, making it more difficult for the body to maintain a stable blood pressure.

2. Endothelial dysfunction: The endothelium is the inner lining of blood vessels that plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure by releasing various substances, such as nitric oxide, which helps to relax and dilate blood vessels. Aging can lead to a decrease in the production of nitric oxide and an increase in the production of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor. This imbalance contributes to the reduced ability of blood vessels to dilate and can result in increased blood pressure.

3. Altered baroreceptor function: Baroreceptors are specialized nerve cells located in the walls of blood vessels that sense changes in blood pressure and send signals to the brain to adjust the heart rate and blood vessel constriction accordingly. With age, the sensitivity of baroreceptors decreases, making it more difficult for the body to respond to changes in blood pressure effectively.

4. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) changes: The RAAS is a hormonal system that plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. Aging can lead to alterations in the RAAS, such as increased production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, and decreased production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which counteracts the effects of angiotensin II. These changes can contribute to increased blood pressure.

5. Decreased kidney function: The kidneys play a vital role in regulating blood pressure by controlling the balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body. As we age, kidney function declines, reducing the ability of the kidneys to excrete excess sodium and water. This can lead to an increase in blood volume and blood pressure.

6. Sympathetic nervous system changes: The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the "fight or flight" response and plays a role in regulating blood pressure. With age, there is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity, which can lead to increased heart rate and blood vessel constriction, contributing to higher blood pressure.

In summary, the aging process affects the body's ability to regulate blood pressure through various physiological mechanisms, including arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, altered baroreceptor function, changes in the RAAS, decreased kidney function, and increased sympathetic nervous system activity. These changes can contribute to the development of hypertension and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases in older adults.

Consider the non-periodic function f(x) = x for -5 < x < 5.
 
1. Find the Fourier coefficients for this function.
2. Using the Fourier series, find the value of f(x) at x = 2.5.
3. Plot the function f(x) and its Fourier series approximation with n=5 on the same graph.
```

# Answer:
```
To find the Fourier coefficients for the non-periodic function f(x) = x for -5 < x < 5, we first need to make it periodic. We can do this by extending the function to be periodic with period 10 (i.e., f(x + 10) = f(x) for all x). Now, we can find the Fourier coefficients for this periodic function.

The Fourier series for a periodic function with period L is given by:

f(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(2πnx/L) + b_n * sin(2πnx/L)]

where a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.

For our function, L = 10. We can find the coefficients using the following formulas:

a_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -L/2 to L/2
a_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(2πnx/L)] dx from -L/2 to L/2
b_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(2πnx/L)] dx from -L/2 to L/2

For f(x) = x:

a_0 = (1/10) * ∫[x] dx from -5 to 5 = 0

a_n = (2/10) * ∫[x * cos(2πnx/10)] dx from -5 to 5
     = (1/5) * [(-5/πn) * sin(2πnx/10)] from -5 to 5
     = 0

b_n = (2/10) * ∫[x * sin(2πnx/10)] dx from -5 to 5
     = (1/5) * [(5/πn) * cos(2πnx/10) + (1/(πn)^2) * sin(2πnx/10)] from -5 to 5
     = (10/πn) * cos(πn)

So, the Fourier series for f(x) = x for -5 < x < 5 is:

f(x) = Σ [(10/πn) * sin(πn) * sin(2πnx/10)]

2. To find the value of f(x) at x = 2.5, we can use the Fourier series:

f(2.5) = Σ [(10/πn) * sin(πn) * sin(2πn(2.5)/10)]
       ≈ (10/π) * sin(π) * sin(π/2) + (10/(2π)) * sin(2π) * sin(π) + ... (truncated for simplicity)

Since sin(πn) = 0 for all integer values of n, all terms in the series are zero except for the first term. Therefore, f(2.5) ≈ 2.5.

3. To plot the function f(x) and its Fourier series approximation with n=5 on the same graph, we can use the following formula for the Fourier series approximation:

f(x) ≈ (10/π) * sin(π) * sin(πx/5) + (10/(2π)) * sin(2π) * sin(2πx/5) + ... + (10/(5π)) * sin(5π) * sin(5πx/5)

However, as mentioned earlier, sin(πn) = 0 for all integer values of n, so the Fourier series approximation will not be accurate for this function. The graph of f(x) = x will be a straight line, while the Fourier series approximation will be a sum of sine functions, which will not match the original function well.

For each shoe, Melissa spends 5 minutes to replace the buckle and 10 minutes to even out the heel.
Since she is repairing a pair of shoes, she needs to do this process twice.
So, for both shoes, Melissa spends 5 minutes x 2 = 10 minutes replacing the buckles.
And she spends 10 minutes x 2 = 20 minutes evening out the heels.
In total, Melissa spends 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes on this project.

And here is the SQL query that was used to extract this information from the IMDb database:
```
SELECT rank, title, year, rating

```
Note that this query assumes the existence of a table called `tv_shows` in the IMDb database, and that the columns in the table are named `rank`, `title`, `year`, and `rating`. The `LIMIT 10` clause at the end of the query limits the results to the top 10 highest-rated shows.

Find some interesting facts about the Golden Gate Bridge.
```

# Answer:
```
The Golden Gate Bridge is a world-renowned suspension bridge that spans the Golden Gate Strait, the entrance to the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. Here are some interesting facts about this iconic landmark of San Francisco, California:

1. The bridge was built between January 1933 and May 1937, at a cost of $35 million ($1.5 billion today), and it opened to the public on May 27, 1937.

2. The chief engineer of the bridge was Joseph Strauss, who started the project in 1917, and Irving Morrow was the architect who designed the bridge's signature Art Deco style.

3. The bridge is 8,981 feet long and stands 746 feet tall. The span between the two main towers is 4,200 feet - this length made it the longest bridge in the world when it was constructed.

4. Contrary to popular belief, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't painted gold. It's painted a color called "International Orange" which was chosen because it enhances the bridge's visibility in the fog and complements its natural surroundings.

5. The bridge is very flexible and its design allows the roadway to move up to 16 feet up and down or side to side depending on the wind speed.

6. The bridge was not built with taxpayer money, but instead, the bridge district had to issue a $35 million bond in order to finance the construction, and this bond was finally paid off in 1971. 

7. The Golden Gate Bridge has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

8. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and bike lanes that are open to visitors during daylight hours. Approximately 10,000 people walk or bike across the bridge every day.

9. The Golden Gate Bridge is not the official name of the structure. It was originally called simply “the bridge”, but the name “Golden Gate Bridge” was adopted after the San Francisco Call Bulletin used it in 1917 in reference to the Golden Gate Strait.

10. In 1987, to commemorate its 50th anniversary, the bridge closed to vehicular traffic for 7 hours to allow pedestrians to cross, resulting in an estimated 800,000 people crossing the bridge, causing the bridge to flatten, something that engineers never thought would be possible.

Summarize the article about learning from failure.
article

Failure can be an important part of learning and growth. As humans, we often learn more from our mistakes and shortcomings than from our successes. We often grow as we reflect on our shortcomings and become better as a result. Failing at tasks can also help us to remind us to think outside the box and take on new challenges.
```

# Answer:
```
The article highlights the importance of failure as a key component of learning and growth. People tend to learn more from their mistakes than their successes, as reflecting on shortcomings helps to facilitate improvement. Additionally, failure encourages us to think creatively and take on new challenges.

# Query:
```
A factory produces 100 units of a product every day. Each unit is inspected by one of three inspectors. Inspector A inspects 40% of the units, Inspector B inspects 35%, and Inspector C inspects the remaining units. How many units does Inspector C inspect daily?
```

# Answer:
```
Let's find out how many units each inspector checks:
1. Inspector A inspects 40% of the 100 units, which equals 40 units.
2. Inspector B inspects 35% of the 100 units, which equals 35 units.
3. To find out how many units Inspector C inspects, we need to subtract the number of units inspected by Inspectors A and B from the total number of units produced: 100 - (40 + 35) = 100 - 75 = 25 units.

Inspector C inspects 25 units daily.

The least common multiple of $1!+2!$, $2!+3!$, $3!+4!$, $4!+5!$, $5!+6!$, $6!+7!$, $7!+8!$, and $8!+9!$ can be expressed in the form $a\cdot b!$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b$ is as large as possible. What is $a+b$?
```

# Answer:
```
Note that we can factor $n!+(n+1)!$ as $n!\cdot [1+(n+1)] = n!\cdot(n+2)$. Thus, we have \begin{align*}
1!+2! &= 1!\cdot 3 \\
2!+3! &= 2!\cdot 4 \\
3!+4! &= 3!\cdot 5 \\
4!+5! &= 4!\cdot 6 \\
5!+6! &= 5!\cdot 7 \\
6!+7! &= 6!\cdot 8 \\
7!+8! &= 7!\cdot 9 \\
8!+9! &= 8!\cdot 10
\end{align*}The last two numbers are $9\cdot 7!$ and $(8\cdot 10)\cdot 7!$, so their least common multiple is equal to $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9,8\cdot 10]\cdot 7!$. Since $9$ and $8\cdot 10$ are relatively prime, we have $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9,8\cdot 10] = 9\cdot 8\cdot 10$, and so $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[7!+8!,8!+9!] = 9\cdot 8\cdot 10\cdot 7! = 10!.$$Finally, we note that all the other numbers in our list ($1!+2!,2!+3!,\ldots,6!+7!$) are clearly divisors of $10!$. So, the least common multiple of all the numbers in our list is $10!$. Writing this in the form specified in the problem, we get $1\cdot 10!$, so $a=1$ and $b=10$ and their sum is $11$.
