# Query:
```
I have a small program written in Rust where I am calling a Windows API. I want to ensure that everything went smoothly during the API call. To achieve this, I am using the functionality provided by `std::io::Error::last_os_error()`. However, I also want to ignore certain errors that may occur intentionally. I couldn't find any information on how to achieve this other than just printing out the `Error` returned by that function. What I actually need is a way to handle the different known errors using a match statement.

I understand that the function returns an `std::io::Error` struct, but I couldn't find any information on error IDs or similar concepts. Currently, my code looks like this:

```rust
use std::io::Error;

fn main() {
    // do some stuff that may lead to an error

    match Error::last_os_error() {
        163 => // Do nothing. This error is to be expected
        // _ =>  Err("Something went wrong "),
    }
}
```

The problem I'm facing is that `last_os_error()` returns an error struct, but I want to match against the ID of the error listed in `WinError.h` (since my program only runs under Windows).

Can anybody assist me in how to differentiate between the various errors behind the error structs within a match statement?
```

# Answer:
```
To match against the specific error codes listed in `WinError.h`, you can use `io::Error::raw_os_error()` to retrieve the original error code and then match against it. Here's an example:

```rust
match Error::last_os_error().raw_os_error() {
    Some(163) => {} // Do nothing. This error is to be expected
    Some(e) => panic!("Unknown OS error {}", e),
    None => panic!("Not an OS error!"),
}
```

Note that whether this approach is a good idea or not is a different question. You can also match against known error types. I recommend using that approach whenever possible. Additionally, you may consider creating (or finding) an enum that maps the various error codes to human-readable values. This can make your code more readable and easier to maintain.

There are 10 6-ounces of glasses that are only 4/5 full of water. How many ounces of water are needed to fill to the brim all those 10 glasses?
```

# Answer:
```
Each glass is 6 ounces and is only 4/5 full, so there are 6 * 4/5 = <<6*4/5=4.8>>4.8 ounces of water in each glass.
To fill each glass to the brim, we need an additional 6 - 4.8 = <<6-4.8=1.2>>1.2 ounces of water.
Since there are 10 glasses, we need a total of 1.2 * 10 = <<1.2*10=12>>12 ounces of water to fill all the glasses to the brim.
#### 12
The answer is: 12
